- AranaiRa (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/aranaira): A huge thank you for improving the Ocarina texture from its bland, original self and allowing me to use the modified version in this mod. An even bigger thank you for dramtically improving the enchanted carrot texture with a beautiful animation! Thank you so much.
